Only two nodes for agent
sklern for tool filtering
dynamic playwright tool registration
generated scrips also act as tools for subsequent runs
generated scrips will have a unique name based on the llm context when script is saved 
no innovative changes should done without my permission
minumum changes to current code
always add meaningful debug logging
when ask to compare with a branch just do it and no innovative changes should done without my permission
have a good highlevel overview of the code
have a good highlevel overview of the change and the impact

project objective is to build a self improving browser automation system that specializes in testing a specific web application by:
1. Starting with basic Playwright functions (click, fill, navigate)
2. Learning from user interactions to create reusable test functions
3. Save the interactions as scripts
4. Continuously improving test coverage and reliability
