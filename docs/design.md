# Browser Automation Agent with LangGraph

## 🎯 DOM Tree Highlighting Design

### Overview
The DOM tree highlighting system is a critical component that helps visualize and interact with elements on the page. It consists of several key components working together:

1. **DOM Tree Construction**
   - Recursively builds a tree representation of the page's DOM
   - Handles special cases like iframes, shadow DOM, and rich text editors
   - Caches element properties for performance

2. **Element Analysis**
   - `isElementVisible()`: Checks if an element is visible on the page
   - `isInteractiveElement()`: Determines if an element is interactive (clickable, typeable)
   - `isTopElement()`: Verifies if an element is the topmost at its position
   - `isInExpandedViewport()`: Checks if element is within the expanded viewport

3. **Highlighting System**
   - Creates a high z-index overlay container
   - Draws highlight boxes around interactive elements
   - Shows element numbers for reference
   - Handles cleanup of highlights

### Key Features

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Caches bounding rectangles
   - Caches computed styles
   - Caches client rects
   - Uses WeakMap to prevent memory leaks

2. **Robust Element Detection**
   - Handles common interactive tags (a, button, input, etc.)
   - Supports ARIA roles and attributes
   - Detects click handlers and cursor styles
   - Considers contenteditable elements

3. **Visual Feedback**
   - Hot pink highlight borders for visibility
   - Numbered labels for element reference
   - Handles scrolling and fixed positioning
   - Cleans up highlights properly

### Implementation Details

1. **buildDomTree Function**
   ```javascript
   function buildDomTree(args) {
     const { doHighlightElements, focusHighlightIndex, viewportExpansion } = args;
     // Initialize caches and observers
     // Build DOM tree recursively
     // Handle cleanup
     return { rootId, map: DOM_HASH_MAP };
   }
   ```

2. **Element Visibility**
   ```javascript
   function isElementVisible(element) {
     return (
       element.offsetWidth > 0 &&
       element.offsetHeight > 0 &&
       style.visibility !== "hidden" &&
       style.display !== "none" &&
       style.opacity !== "0"
     );
   }
   ```

3. **Highlighting**
   ```javascript
   function highlightElement(element, index) {
     const position = getElementPosition(element);
     // Create highlight overlay
     // Add number label
     return index + 1;
   }
   ```

### Integration with Python

1. **DOMService Class**
   ```python
   class DOMService:
       def __init__(self, page: Page):
           self.page = page
           self._build_dom_tree_js = load_script("buildDomTree.js")

       async def get_dom_tree(self, highlight_elements: bool = False):
           return await self.page.evaluate(self._build_dom_tree_js, args)
   ```

2. **Element Interaction**
   ```python
   async def click_element(self, element_hash: str) -> bool:
       element = self._element_map.get(element_hash)
       if not element:
           return False
       await element.click()
       return True
   ```

### Design Decisions

1. **No Icon Integration**
   - Keep highlighting system focused on core functionality
   - Avoid complexity of icon management
   - Use simple numbered labels instead

2. **Performance First**
   - Extensive caching of element properties
   - Minimal DOM operations
   - Efficient cleanup

3. **Robust Element Detection**
   - Multiple methods to detect interactive elements
   - Careful handling of edge cases
   - Proper cleanup of resources



## 🧭 Design Principles

1. **Simplicity First**
   - Minimal abstractions and layers
   - Direct Playwright API access
   - No unnecessary frameworks or complex patterns
   - Easy to understand and modify code

2. **Progressive Enhancement**
   - Start with basic browser interactions
   - Add complexity only when needed
   - Keep the core lean and focused

3. **Transparent Execution**
   - Clear visibility into what's happening
   - No magic or hidden behaviors
   - Easy debugging and inspection

## 🎯 Core Concept

```

## 🧩 Node 1: Tool Selection Node

**Purpose:** Analyze user request and select appropriate tool(s)

**Inputs:**
- User prompt
- Current page state
- Available tools (base + learned)
- Execution history

**Logic:**
```python
def tool_selection_node(state):
    user_intent = state["user_prompt"]
    available_tools = state["tool_registry"]
    current_context = state["browser_context"]
    
    # LLM decides which tool to use
    selected_tool = llm.choose_tool(
        intent=user_intent,
        tools=available_tools,
        context=current_context
    )
    
    state["selected_tool"] = selected_tool
    state["tool_args"] = extract_arguments(user_intent, selected_tool)
    
    return state
```

## 🔧 Node 2: Tool Execution Node

**Purpose:** Execute selected tool and detect patterns for learning

**Logic:**
```python
def tool_execution_node(state):
    tool_name = state["selected_tool"]
    tool_args = state["tool_args"]
    
    # Execute the tool
    result = execute_tool(tool_name, tool_args)
    
    # Record the action
    state["action_history"].append({
        "tool": tool_name,
        "args": tool_args,
        "result": result,
        "timestamp": now(),
        "page_state": get_page_state()
    })
    
    # Pattern detection
    if detect_reusable_pattern(state["action_history"]):
        new_tool = generate_composite_tool(state["action_history"])
        register_new_tool(new_tool)
        state["tool_registry"].append(new_tool)
    
    return state
```

## 📊 State Management

**LangGraph State Schema:**
```python
class BrowserTestState(TypedDict):
    # User Input
    user_prompt: str
    original_objective: str
    
    # Tool Management
    tool_registry: List[Tool]
    selected_tool: str
    tool_args: Dict
    
    # Browser Context
    current_url: str
    page_elements: List[Dict]
    browser_context: Dict
    
    # Learning & History
    action_history: List[Action]
    detected_patterns: List[Pattern]
    
    # Execution State
    task_complete: bool
    execution_result: Any
    error_state: Optional[str]
```

## 🔄 Workflow Example

**User Input:** "Login with admin credentials and create a new product"

### **Step 1: Tool Selection**
- Identifies need for login and product creation
- Selects existing `login_admin` tool

### **Step 2: Tool Execution**
- Executes `login_admin()`
- Records successful login

### **Step 3: Tool Selection (Product Creation)**
- No existing product creation tool found
- Falls back to base Playwright tools

### **Step 4: Pattern Detection**
After multiple executions, detects pattern:
```python
def create_product(product_name, product_price):
    page.goto('/products/new')
    page.fill('#product-name', product_name)
    page.fill('#product-price', product_price)
    page.click('#save-button')
```

### **Step 5: Tool Registration**
- Adds `create_product` to tool registry
- Available for future test scenarios

## 🛠️ Tool Registry

**Base Tools (Playwright):**
- `navigate(url)`
- `click(selector)`
- `fill(selector, text)`
- `extract_text(selector)`

**Learned Tools (Generated):**
- `login_admin()`
- `create_product(name, price)`
- `search_products(query)`
- `update_user_profile(data)`

## 🔍 Pattern Detection Rules

1. **Sequence Length**: 3+ related actions
2. **Repeatability**: Same sequence used multiple times
3. **Parameterization**: Actions with variable inputs
4. **Logical Cohesion**: Actions serving single purpose

```python
def detect_reusable_pattern(action_history):
    recent_actions = action_history[-10:]  # Last 10 actions
    
    # Look for sequences
    for i in range(len(recent_actions) - 2):
        sequence = recent_actions[i:i+4]  # 4-action window
        
        if is_logical_sequence(sequence):
            return create_tool_from_sequence(sequence)
    
    return None
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Initialize Agent**
```python
agent = BrowserAgent(
    target_url="https://your-app.com",
    headless=False
)
```

2. **Run Test Scenario**
```python
result = await agent.run("Login and create test product")
```

3. **View Learned Functions**
```python
print(agent.list_tools())
# ['navigate', 'click', 'fill', 'login_admin', 'create_product']
```

## 📈 Benefits

- **Faster Test Creation**: Reuses learned functions
- **Self-Improving**: Gets better with usage
- **Domain-Specific**: Specializes in your application
- **Maintainable**: Centralized function management

## 🔄 Continuous Learning Loop

1. **Execute** tests using available tools
2. **Record** actions and outcomes
3. **Detect** patterns in successful sequences
4. **Generate** new reusable functions
5. **Improve** test coverage and reliability

End-to-End Flow: From User Prompt to Browser Automation
Let me explain the complete flow of how the talk2browser system processes a user request, from initial navigation to subsequent tool selection with browser details and interactive elements. I'll use a simple example of searching for "playwright python" on GitHub.

Flow Overview
CopyInsert
User Prompt → Tool Selection → Browser Action → Page State Update → Tool Selection → Browser Action → Result
Detailed Flow with Example
1. Initial User Request
User prompt: "Go to GitHub and search for playwright python"

2. Initial State Creation
python
CopyInsert
initial_state = {
    "messages": [HumanMessage(content="Go to GitHub and search for playwright python")]
}
3. First Tool Selection Node Execution
The _chatbot method in the agent processes this request:

Get current page state: Initially empty or showing "about:blank"
Format page state for LLM: "Current page: about:blank (No interactive elements)"
Enhance user message with page context:
CopyInsert
"Go to GitHub and search for playwright python

Current Page Context:
URL: about:blank
Title: 
No interactive elements found on the page."
Present tools to LLM: The LLM sees all available tools from the registry, including navigate_to
LLM selects tool: The LLM chooses navigate_to with URL "https://github.com"
4. First Tool Execution
The tools node executes the selected tool:

python
CopyInsert
# Tool execution
result = tool_registry.execute_tool("navigate_to", {"url": "https://github.com"})
Browser navigates to GitHub: The page loads github.com
Page state is captured: URL, title, and interactive elements are collected
Result is returned: "Successfully navigated to https://github.com"
5. Return to Chatbot Node
The graph returns to the chatbot node with updated messages:

python
CopyInsert
messages = [
    HumanMessage(content="Go to GitHub and search for playwright python"),
    AIMessage(content="I'll navigate to GitHub and search for playwright python."),
    ToolMessage(content="Successfully navigated to https://github.com")
]
6. Second Tool Selection
Now the chatbot node runs again with the updated state:

Get current page state: Now contains GitHub's homepage elements
Discover interactive elements:
CopyInsert
# Example elements discovered
elements = [
  {
    "type": "input",
    "tag": "input",
    "input_type": "text",
    "description": "Search GitHub",
    "selector": ".header-search-input",
    "element_id": "a7f3b9c2"  # Hashed ID for stable reference
  },
  {
    "type": "clickable",
    "tag": "a",
    "text": "Sign in",
    "description": "Sign in",
    "selector": "a[href='/login']",
    "element_id": "8e2d1f5a"
  },
  # More elements...
]
Format elements for LLM:
CopyInsert
Current Page Context:
URL: https://github.com
Title: GitHub: Let's build from here

Interactive Elements:
Input Fields:
  1. Search GitHub (selector: .header-search-input)

Clickable Elements:
  1. Sign in (selector: a[href='/login'])
  2. Sign up (selector: a[href='/signup'])
  # More elements...
LLM selects next tool: The LLM chooses fill_input for the search box
7. Second Tool Execution
python
CopyInsert
# Tool execution with element reference
result = tool_registry.execute_tool("fill_input", {
    "selector": ".header-search-input", 
    "text": "playwright python"
})
Browser fills the input: The search box is filled with "playwright python"
Page state is updated: Same URL but with filled input field
Result is returned: "Successfully filled input with text: playwright python"
8. Third Tool Selection
The chatbot node runs again:

Get updated page state: Now contains GitHub's homepage with filled search box
LLM selects next tool: The LLM chooses press_key to submit the search
9. Third Tool Execution
python
CopyInsert
# Tool execution to submit the form
result = tool_registry.execute_tool("press_key", {
    "selector": ".header-search-input",
    "key": "Enter"
})
Browser presses Enter: The search form is submitted
Page navigates to search results: URL changes to search results page
New page state is captured: Now contains search results elements
Result is returned: "Successfully pressed Enter key"
10. Final Tool Selection
The chatbot node runs one more time:

Get updated page state: Now contains GitHub search results page
Format elements for LLM:
CopyInsert
Current Page Context:
URL: https://github.com/search?q=playwright+python
Title: Search results for 'playwright python' - GitHub

Interactive Elements:
Clickable Elements:
  1. microsoft/playwright-python (selector: a[href='/microsoft/playwright-python'])
  2. Next (selector: a.next_page)
  # More elements...
LLM recognizes task completion: The LLM sees that we've successfully searched for "playwright python"
LLM provides final response: "I've searched GitHub for 'playwright python'. The search results show microsoft/playwright-python as the top result..."
Key Components in Detail
1. Element Discovery and Hashing
python
CopyInsert
async def _discover_interactive_elements(self, page):
    # Find clickable elements (buttons, links)
    clickable_elements = await page.query_selector_all('button, a, [role="button"]')
    
    # Find input fields
    input_elements = await page.query_selector_all('input, textarea, select')
    
    # Process and extract properties for each element
    elements = []
    
    for element in clickable_elements:
        # Extract properties
        tag = await element.evaluate('el => el.tagName.toLowerCase()')
        text = await element.evaluate('el => el.innerText || el.textContent || ""')
        
        # Generate a stable selector
        selector = await element.evaluate('''el => {
            if (el.id) return #${el.id};
            if (el.className) return .${el.className.split(' ')[0]};
            return '';
        }''')
        
        # If no good selector was found, use a more complex one
        if not selector:
            selector = await page.evaluate('el => CSS.escape(el)', element)
        
        # Hash the element for stable reference
        element_hash = self._hash_element(tag, text, selector)
        
        elements.append({
            "type": "clickable",
            "tag": tag,
            "text": text,
            "selector": selector,
            "element_id": element_hash
        })
    
    # Similar processing for input elements...
    
    return elements
2. Element Highlighting
When in debug mode, elements can be highlighted to visualize what the agent sees:

python
CopyInsert
async def highlight_element(self, selector, duration_ms=1000):
    """Highlight an element on the page for debugging"""
    page = await self.get_or_create_page()
    
    # Inject highlight styles
    await page.evaluate("""() => {
        const style = document.createElement('style');
        style.innerHTML = 
            .talk2browser-highlight {
                outline: 2px solid red !important;
                background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.2) !important;
            }
        ;
        document.head.appendChild(style);
    }""")
    
    # Highlight the element
    await page.evaluate(f"""(selector) => {{
        const el = document.querySelector(selector);
        if (el) {{
            el.classList.add('talk2browser-highlight');
        }}
    }}""", selector)
    
    # Remove highlight after duration
    if duration_ms > 0:
        await page.wait_for_timeout(duration_ms)
        await page.evaluate(f"""(selector) => {{
            const el = document.querySelector(selector);
            if (el) {{
                el.classList.remove('talk2browser-highlight');
            }}
        }}""", selector)
3. Page State Formatting for LLM
python
CopyInsert
def _format_page_state(self, page_state):
    """Format page state for LLM consumption"""
    url = page_state.get("url", "No URL")
    title = page_state.get("title", "No Title")
    elements = page_state.get("elements", [])
    
    # Format elements by type
    clickable = [e for e in elements if e.get("type") == "clickable"]
    inputs = [e for e in elements if e.get("type") == "input"]
    
    formatted = [
        f"Current Page Context:",
        f"URL: {url}",
        f"Title: {title}",
        f"\nInteractive Elements:"
    ]
    
    # Format input fields
    if inputs:
        formatted.append("Input Fields:")
        for i, element in enumerate(inputs[:5], 1):
            desc = element.get("description") or f"{element.get('input_type', 'text')} input"
            formatted.append(f"  {i}. {desc} (selector: {element.get('selector')})")
    
    # Format clickable elements
    if clickable:
        formatted.append("\nClickable Elements:")
        for i, element in enumerate(clickable[:10], 1):
            text = element.get("text", "").strip()
            desc = text if text else element.get("description", f"{element.get('tag')} element")
            formatted.append(f"  {i}. {desc} (selector: {element.get('selector')})")
    
    return "\n".join(formatted)
Complete Example Flow
Here's a complete example showing the exact flow of messages and state:

User: "Go to GitHub and search for playwright python"
Agent initializes state:
python
CopyInsert
state = {
    "messages": [HumanMessage(content="Go to GitHub and search for playwright python")]
}
Chatbot node processes request:
Gets empty page state
Enhances user message with page context
LLM selects navigate_to tool
Tool node executes navigate_to:
python
CopyInsert
result = "Successfully navigated to https://github.com"
state["messages"].append(ToolMessage(content=result))
Chatbot node runs again:
Gets GitHub homepage state with elements
LLM sees search box in elements list
LLM selects fill_input tool
Tool node executes fill_input:
python
CopyInsert
result = "Successfully filled input with text: playwright python"
state["messages"].append(ToolMessage(content=result))
Chatbot node runs again:
Gets updated page state
LLM selects press_key tool
Tool node executes press_key:
python
CopyInsert
result = "Successfully pressed Enter key"
state["messages"].append(ToolMessage(content=result))
Chatbot node runs final time:
Gets search results page state
LLM recognizes task completion
LLM provides final response
Final response to user: "I've searched GitHub for 'playwright python'. The search results show microsoft/playwright-python as the top result..."
This flow demonstrates how the system continuously updates the page state and presents it to the LLM for context-aware decision making, creating a seamless browser automation experience driven by natural language.

prompt goes to llm via chatbot return with tools selection, tool condtions evaluated and then ?

Revert
Let me explain the exact flow of control in the talk2browser system, focusing on how the prompt is processed through the LangGraph nodes:

Flow Control in talk2browser
CopyInsert
User Prompt → Chatbot Node → Tool Selection → _route_tools → Tool Node → Tool Execution → Back to Chatbot Node
Detailed Step-by-Step Flow
User prompt enters the system
User sends a natural language request
Agent creates initial state with the message
Chatbot Node processes the prompt
Gets current page state (URL, title, elements)
Enhances user message with page context
Presents available tools to LLM
LLM selects appropriate tool and parameters
Returns updated state with tool selection
_route_tools conditional function evaluates
Checks if LLM response contains tool calls
If yes: Routes to "tools" node
If no: Routes to END (conversation complete)
Tool Node executes the selected tool
Receives tool name and parameters
Resolves any element references
Executes the Playwright action
Captures result
Returns updated state with tool execution result
Control returns to Chatbot Node
Gets updated page state after tool execution
LLM evaluates if task is complete
If not complete: Selects next tool
If complete: Provides final response
Cycle repeats until task completion
Each cycle updates the page state
LLM has full context of previous actions
Tool selection becomes more informed with each step
Key Code Sections
1. Graph Definition
python
CopyInsert
def _create_agent_graph(self) -> StateGraph:
    # Create the graph
    graph = StateGraph(AgentState)
    
    # Add nodes
    graph.add_node("chatbot", self._chatbot)
    graph.add_node("tools", tool_node)
    
    # Set entry point
    graph.set_entry_point("chatbot")
    
    # Add conditional edge from chatbot to either tools or END
    graph.add_conditional_edges(
        "chatbot",
        self._route_tools,
        {"tools": "tools", END: END},
    )
    
    # Any time a tool is called, we return to the chatbot
    graph.add_edge("tools", "chatbot")
    graph.add_edge(START, "chatbot")
    
    return graph.compile()
2. Routing Logic
python
CopyInsert
def _route_tools(self, state: AgentState):
    """Route to tools node if tool calls are present, otherwise end the conversation."""
    if not (messages := state.get("messages", [])):
        raise ValueError("No messages found in state")

    ai_message = messages[-1]

    # Count tool calls to prevent infinite loops
    tool_call_count = sum(
        1 for msg in messages 
        if hasattr(msg, "tool_calls") and msg.tool_calls
    )

    # Limit maximum tool calls
    MAX_TOOL_CALLS = 10
    if tool_call_count >= MAX_TOOL_CALLS:
        logger.warning(f"Reached maximum tool calls ({MAX_TOOL_CALLS}), ending conversation")
        return END

    # Check if the last message has tool calls
    if hasattr(ai_message, "tool_calls") and ai_message.tool_calls:
        return "tools"

    # No tool calls
    return END
3. Tool Execution
python
CopyInsert
# In the ToolNode
def execute_tool(self, tool_name, **kwargs):
    """Execute a tool by name with the given parameters"""
    # Get the tool function
    tool_func = self.tool_registry.get_tool(tool_name)
    
    if not tool_func:
        raise ValueError(f"Tool not found: {tool_name}")
    
    # Execute the tool
    result = tool_func(**kwargs)
    
    # Get updated page state after execution
    page_state = self.browser_client.get_page_state_sync()
    
    # Return both the result and updated page state
    return {
        "result": result,
        "page_state": page_state
    }
Example Flow Trace
Here's a trace of the exact execution flow for a simple task:

User: "Go to github.com"
System:
Initial state created
Chatbot node processes request
LLM selects navigate_to tool
_route_tools evaluates to "tools"
Tool node executes navigate_to
Control returns to chatbot node
LLM sees GitHub homepage and task is complete
_route_tools evaluates to END
Final response returned to user
User: "Search for playwright python"
System:
New state created
Chatbot node processes request with GitHub homepage context
LLM selects fill_input tool for search box
_route_tools evaluates to "tools"
Tool node executes fill_input
Control returns to chatbot node
LLM sees filled search box and selects press_key tool
_route_tools evaluates to "tools"
Tool node executes press_key
Control returns to chatbot node
LLM sees search results and task is complete
_route_tools evaluates to END
Final response returned to user
This flow ensures that:

The LLM always has the latest page state for context
Tool selection is informed by the current browser state
Complex tasks are broken down into simple steps
The system can handle multi-step interactions
The key insight is that the LangGraph structure allows for a continuous loop of:

Observe (get page state)
Think (LLM selects tool)
Act (execute tool)
This loop continues until the task is complete or the maximum number of tool calls is reached.

Design Rationale
Browser Module
PlaywrightClient: Encapsulates all browser interaction logic, providing a clean interface for the agent. Handles browser session lifecycle, page management, and element discovery.
element_utils.py: Separates element-specific utilities for better code organization and reuse.
Tools Module
ToolRegistry: Central registry for all available tools, enabling dynamic discovery of Playwright methods and conversion to LLM-compatible tool schemas.
base_tools/: Organized by functional categories (navigation, interaction, query) for better maintainability.
Agent Module
BrowserAgent: Main entry point for user interactions, integrating LLM, browser client, and tool registry. Follows the same pattern as talk2n8n for consistency.
AgentState: TypedDict for LangGraph state management, ensuring type safety and clear state structure.
Core Module
Separates LangGraph-specific logic from agent implementation, allowing for easier updates to the graph structure.
nodes.py: Contains the core logic for tool selection and execution, keeping these concerns separate from the agent class.
Utils Module
Provides shared utilities across the codebase, promoting code reuse and consistency.
logging.py: Implements clean, concise logging as per user preference.
Tests
Organized into unit and integration tests for comprehensive test coverage.
Each major component has its own test file for focused testing.
Examples
Provides ready-to-use examples that demonstrate common use cases, serving as both documentation and validation of the system's capabilities.
This structure follows the principles of:

Modularity: Clear separation of concerns
Simplicity: Direct, minimal abstractions

query.py:
Page query tools (get_text, get_attribute, screenshot) why we need since dynamic tool registration, also can combine Agent Module
BrowserAgent: Main entry point for user interactions, integrating LLM, browser client, and tool registry. Follows the same pattern as talk2n8n for consistency.
AgentState: TypedDict for LangGraph state management, ensuring type safety and clear state structure.
Core Module
Separates LangGraph-specific logic from agent implementation, allowing for easier updates to the graph structure.
nodes.py: Contains the core logic for tool selection and execution, keeping these concerns separate from the agent class. ?

You raise excellent points about potential redundancies in the proposed structure. Let me address your concerns and suggest a simplified approach that better aligns with dynamic tool registration and the talk2n8n pattern.

Simplified Structure: Addressing Redundancies
Regarding base_tools/ vs. Dynamic Tool Registration
You're absolutely right. If we're implementing dynamic tool discovery from Playwright methods, having predefined tool files (navigation.py, interaction.py, query.py) creates redundancy. Here's a better approach:

Revised Tools Module
src/talk2browser/tools/
init.py: Module initialization
registry.py:
ToolRegistry: Dynamically discovers and registers Playwright methods as tools
custom_tools.py:
Contains only custom tools that extend beyond basic Playwright functionality
Examples: composite actions or domain-specific tools learned over time
This approach eliminates redundancy while preserving the ability to add custom tools that go beyond what Playwright provides directly.

Regarding Agent Module and Core Module Separation
You're also right to question the separation between the Agent and Core modules. Following the talk2n8n pattern more closely, we can simplify by merging these:

Revised Agent Module
src/talk2browser/agent/
init.py: Module initialization
agent.py:
BrowserAgent: Main agent class that:
Processes user requests
Defines and manages the LangGraph structure
Handles tool selection and execution logic
AgentState: TypedDict for LangGraph state management
This consolidation:

Follows the talk2n8n pattern more closely
Reduces unnecessary abstraction layers
Keeps related functionality together

Rationale for the Simplified Approach
Dynamic Tool Discovery: Since we're dynamically discovering Playwright methods, predefined tool files are redundant. The ToolRegistry can handle discovering, categorizing, and registering all Playwright methods.
Consolidated Agent Logic: Following the talk2n8n pattern more closely, the BrowserAgent class can handle both the agent logic and LangGraph integration, eliminating the need for a separate Core module.
Simplicity Principle: This aligns with your preference for simplicity and minimal abstractions while maintaining clean separation of concerns.
Reduced Boilerplate: Fewer files and classes mean less boilerplate code and easier maintenance.
Clearer Responsibility: Each component has a well-defined responsibility:
PlaywrightClient: Browser interaction and element discovery
ToolRegistry: Tool discovery and execution
BrowserAgent: User interaction, LLM integration, and workflow orchestration
This simplified structure maintains the core functionality while eliminating redundant components, making the codebase more maintainable and aligned with your preference for clean, concise implementations.

I've updated the design document with a new section that outlines the simplified project structure and key components. The update includes:

Project Structure Overview - A clear directory layout showing the organization of the codebase
Key Components - Brief descriptions of the main modules and their responsibilities
File Organization - A clean, minimal structure that aligns with the simplified approach we discussed
The structure maintains the core functionality while being much simpler than browser-use, focusing on:

Dynamic tool discovery instead of predefined tools
A single agent class that handles LangGraph integration
Minimal but effective module separation
Would you like me to add any other details about the implementation approach or specific components?

Browser Automation Agent with LangGraph

🎯 Objective of the MVP

To develop a minimal, self-improving browser automation agent using LangGraph and Playwright that can:

Interpret user instructions via natural language

Perform real browser actions (navigate, click, fill)

Learn reusable domain-specific functions from user interactions

Dynamically discover and manage tools without hardcoding

Offer maintainable, explainable, and extensible automation for a specific application domain

This MVP aims to validate the technical feasibility of combining LangGraph, Playwright, and LLMs for automated web testing with progressive learning and minimal developer effort.

✅ MVP Success Criteria

Can execute simple multi-step flows via user prompt (e.g., “Go to GitHub and search for Playwright Python”)

LLM correctly interprets user intent and selects tools via LangGraph

Browser context (URL, title, elements) is updated and fed into the LLM between steps

Tools are dynamically discovered and callable without hardcoding

Learned composite tools (e.g., login_user) can be automatically generated and reused

CLI interface can run prompt-driven flows with visible logging

Codebase remains under 10 files with minimal abstractions
